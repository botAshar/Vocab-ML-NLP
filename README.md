# Vocab-ML-NLP #
I have decided to improve my vocubulary by utilizing my machine learning skills to cluster similar meaning words togather so they are easier to learn. The following task are performed in the code:
* Checking the List of 3500 GRE Barron Vocubulary List
* Extracting the synonyms Using RapidAPI
* Extracting the missing synonyms using Web scrapping using Beautiful Soup
* Creating Bags of words using Dictionary from Gensim
* Creating TFIDF array of the words
* Applying the SVD on the matrix of the words for reducing dimensionally reduction.
* Applying Custom K-means using Cosine Similarity on the Reduced matrix
* Extracting the word Clusters
* I plan on using gensim word2vec and Annoy to better improve the accuracy of this process. *
